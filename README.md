# Dog-Face-Recognition
A dog that goes missing is among many worst fears.

Owners have a handful of ways to locate lost dogs, including collar tags and implanted microchips.

Collar tags are cheap, but easily lost. In addition, not all dogs tolerate wearing a collar all the time.

Implanted chips are more robust, but also more expensive.

Some first world countries require chip implant mandatory, but in other countries, implants are virtually unheard of.

Our project, retrieving lost dogs by facial features, is designed to be convenient for both owners and dogs, accessible and with high accuracy.

All of these will try to overcome the limitations mentioned above.
